# About this Markdown Edition

*Warez: The Infrastructure and Aesthetics of Piracy* was written by Martin Paul Eve 

It was first published in 2021 by [punctum books](https://punctumbooks.com), a non-for-profit public benefit corporation. It was published both in print, as a a PDF using the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 International license.

While I am so appreciated to Martin and punctum for freely releasing the PDF, this format is not the most ideal for reading on a variety of devices. As such, I used some one-off software and some manual work to convert the PDF into Markdown.

Specifically I:

* Converted the PDF into plain text. 
* Broken the chapters out into individual files.
* De-pagenated the text to remove the hard line wraps, and then un-hyphenated many of the words that were originally hyphened to span a line.
* Moved all footnotes to the end of each chapter
* Converted footnotes into [Github Flavored Markdown Footnotes](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#footnotes)
* Extracted high resolution images from the PDF
* Converted block quotes, lists, and pre-formatted text into the Markdown equivalent, where appropriate.

## What's Missing

The original work contained a 71 page Appendix, consistently almost entirely of a table describing all known Topsites from the shroo.ms nfo.sites collection. Due to the structure of PDFs, this did not convert cleanly into plain text. Reformatting all of this content into a Markdown table would be a tremendous amount of work, and personally I found this content of little value. If you wish to read the Appendix, you may consult the source PDF.
